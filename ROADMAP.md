1. Implement a Project Name input form. It's a top-level component. It starts blank. When the user types a project name, the app state keeps track.
When the user submits, the app sends a get request to the database. If the project is a new project, the database creates a new entry for it. If the project exists, the database sends back all the information related to that project. The client then updates its state with that information and displays it.
2. Implement the list component. The list component displays the data passed to it, if any, but always has a box at the end for adding another item.  First, implement that blank box.
